==Configuration==
====Client:====
{{{
    ns_section "ns/server/$server/module/dci/neval"
        ns_param address $address
        ns_param port $nevalPort
        ns_param password $encryptedPassword ; # ns_crypt $password t2
        ns_param allowed 127.0.0.1
}}}

==Usage==
In the tool AOLserver Control Port send a command to the frontend server (See [Topology] for more detail):
{{{
    [neon:~/svn/nsdci/wiki] Michael% telnet 127.0.0.1 8900
    Trying 127.0.0.1...
    Connected to localhost.
    Escape character is '^]'.
    login: 
    Password: 

    Welcome to tool running at /usr/local/aolserver/bin/nsd (pid 6930)
    AOLserver/4.5.0 (aolserver4_5) for osx built on Jan  4 2007 at 17:11:28
    CVS Tag: $Name:  $
    tool:nscp 1> neval.send 127.0.0.1 9600 neval "ns_log notice foo"

    tool:nscp 2> exit

    Goodbye!
    Connection closed by foreign host.

}}}

Looking at the tool server log you will see the following log entry:

{{{
    [07/Jan/2007:18:10:43][6930.25205760][-nscp:4-] Notice: neval: send to 127.0.0.1:9600: {ns_log notice foo}
}}}

Looking in the frontend server log you will the connection as well as the result of the command since it was a log notice:

{{{
    [07/Jan/2007:18:10:43][6928.25189376][-socks-] Notice: neval: connected to 127.0.0.1
    [07/Jan/2007:18:10:43][6928.25189376][-socks-] Notice: neval: queued 127.0.0.1
    [07/Jan/2007:18:10:43][6928.25208832][-neval-] Notice: recv from 127.0.0.1: {ns_log notice foo}
    [07/Jan/2007:18:10:43][6928.25208832][-neval-] Notice: foo

}}}
